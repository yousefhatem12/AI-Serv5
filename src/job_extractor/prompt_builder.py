=== ZERO-FABRICATION RULES (MANDATORY) ===
1. ROLE_FAMILY: Set to null unless a specific, well-defined professional discipline or department
   is explicitly stated in the JD or directly evident from a specific role title
   (e.g. "Engineering", "Data", "Design", "Product", "Marketing").
   If the job posting is generic, vague, or lacks a well-defined professional domain (e.g. "looking for a developer"),
   return null. Never guess or extrapolate from single generic words.
2. SENIORITY: Set to null unless an explicit seniority level token is present in the text
   (e.g. "Senior", "Junior", "Lead", "Mid-level", "Entry-level", "Staff", "Principal", "Intern").
   Do NOT infer seniority from required years of experience or general phrasing.
3. CANONICAL_ROLE: Normalize the job title only if a complete, specific, recognized job title
   is stated in the JD (e.g. "Backend Engineer", "Data Analyst", "DevOps Specialist", "Flutter Developer").
   If the JD mentions only an ambiguous descriptor or generic noun without specifying the discipline
   (e.g. "a developer", "an engineer", "a specialist"), return null.
   Never invent a specific title (e.g. do not turn an unspecified "developer" into "Software Engineer").
4. SKILLS: Extract ONLY verifiable technical skills, domain-specific tools, programming languages,
   frameworks, databases, cloud platforms, and established professional methodologies explicitly mentioned in the JD.
   - Do NOT extract interpersonal virtues, behavioral habits, or personality traits
     (e.g. "team player", "fast learner", "self-starter", "hard worker", "detail-oriented", "motivated") as skills.
   - Do NOT extract company-internal, proprietary, or fictional in-house tools as platform skills.
   - Do NOT invent or assume unmentioned skills.
5. IMPORTANCE: Use keywords to assign importance:
   - "critical" → triggered by: "required", "must have", "must-have", "essential",
     "mandatory", "you must", "deep expertise in", "strong knowledge of"
   - "nice_to_have" → triggered by: "preferred", "nice to have", "bonus", "plus",
     "advantage", "beneficial", "familiarity with", "exposure to"
   - "important" → default for standard requirement mentions without strong markers
6. REQUIRED_LEVEL: Only set ("beginner", "intermediate", "advanced", "expert") if the JD explicitly
   qualifies a proficiency level for that specific skill (e.g. "deep expertise in Python" → "expert").
   Otherwise null.
7. EXPERIENCE: Extract numeric year ranges ONLY (e.g. "5+ years" → min=5, max=null; "3-5 years" → min=3, max=5).
   Do NOT infer years from role seniority. If no numeric years are stated, set min and max to null.
8. CONSTRAINTS: List non-skill, non-experience requirements only: location requirements,
   work authorization (visa/permit), security clearance, specific mandatory licenses.
9. Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT wrap with markdown backticks (```json).
10. All list fields default to [] if nothing is found. All nullable fields default to null.

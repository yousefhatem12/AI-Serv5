"""
Skill normalization layer for the Job Description Understanding pipeline.

Wraps TaxonomyManager to map raw LLM-extracted skill tokens to canonical
skill_id / canonical_name / category from the platform skill taxonomy.

Reuses the singleton TaxonomyManager injected at pipeline construction time
to avoid a duplicate seed-file load.

    Resolve a list of raw skill dicts (from LLM extraction) into NormalizedSkill objects.

    Each raw dict is expected to have keys: name, importance, required_level.

    Taxonomy resolution uses strict=False so that recognized technical tokens

    genuine stop-words and noise are silently dropped.
